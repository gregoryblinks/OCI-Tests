Interpretation
1.  remediation_rate low → these problem names are the ones “mostly not remediated”.
2.  Check dismissal_rate vs still_open to see whether they’re being dismissed or just lingering open.

Use this to answer “why”:
Look at the lowest-rate rows—do they cluster in certain compartments, risks, or resource types? That’s your remediation bottleneck.

One helper view (copy–paste in ADW)
  This wraps your fixed cohort view and adds:
  PROBLEM_NAME (at/after first detection),
  RESOURCE_TYPE (at/after first detection),
  SEVERITY_BUCKET (uses SEVERITY_AT_DETECTION fallback RISK_AT_DETECTION).
